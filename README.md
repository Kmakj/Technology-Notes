# Technology Readme

This is a basic readme which will be a brief on all technology used in the project.

# React

React is a component based method for rending UI using JavaScript expressions.

## JSX

After compilation, JSX expressions become regular JavaScript function calls and evaluate to JavaScript objects. **This means that you can use JSX inside of if statements and for loops, assign it to variables, accept it as arguments, and return it from functions:**

* You may use quotes to specify string literals as attributes:

```
const element = <div tabIndex="0"></div>;
```

* You may also use curly braces to embed a JavaScript expression in an attribute:

```
const element = <img src={user.avatarUrl}></img>;
```

* If a tag is empty, you may close it immediately with />, like XML:

```
const element = <img src={user.avatarUrl} />;
```

#### JSX Represents Objects

Babel compiles JSX down to React.createElement() calls.

These two examples are identical:

```
const element = (
  <h1 className="greeting">
    Hello, world!
  </h1>
);
```

```
const element = React.createElement(
'h1',
{className: 'greeting'},
'Hello, world!'
);
```

React.createElement() performs a few checks to help you write bug-free code but essentially it creates an object like this:

```
// Note: this structure is simplified
const element = {
  type: 'h1',
  props: {
    className: 'greeting',
    children: 'Hello, world'
  }
};
```

These objects are called “React elements”. You can think of them as descriptions of what you want to see on the screen. React reads these objects and uses them to construct the DOM and keep it up to date.

## Rendering Elements

An element describes what you want to see on the screen:

```
const element = <h1>Hello, world</h1>;
```

Unlike browser DOM elements, React elements are plain objects, and are cheap to create. React DOM takes care of updating the DOM to match the React elements.

> **One might confuse elements with a more widely known concept of “components”. Elements are what components are “made of”**

#### Root DOM Node

Let’s say there is a `<div>` somewhere in your HTML file:

```
<div id="root"></div>
```

We call this a “root” DOM node because everything inside it will be managed by React DOM.

Applications built with just React usually have a single root DOM node. If you are integrating React into an existing app, you may have as many isolated root DOM nodes as you like.

To render a React element into a root DOM node, pass both to ReactDOM.render():

```
const element = <h1>Hello, world</h1>;
ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root'));
```

#### Updating the Rendered Element

> **React elements are immutable. Once you create an element, you can’t change its children or attributes. An element is like a single frame in a movie: it represents the UI at a certain point in time**

With our knowledge so far, the only way to update the UI is to create a new element, and pass it to ReactDOM.render().

Consider this ticking clock example:

```
function tick() {
  const element = (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
      <h2>It is {new Date().toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
    </div>
  );
  ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root'));
}
setInterval(tick, 1000);
```

It calls ReactDOM.render() every second from a setInterval() callback.

#### React Only Updates What’s Necessary

React DOM compares the element and its children to the previous one, and only applies the DOM updates necessary to bring the DOM to the desired state.

## Components and Props

#### Functional and Class Components

The simplest way to define a component is to write a JavaScript function:

```
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
```

This function is a valid React component because it accepts a single **props** (which stands for properties) object argument with data and returns a React element. We call such components “functional” because they are literally JavaScript functions.

You can also use an ES6 class to define a component:

```
class Welcome extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
  }
}
```

The above two components are equivalent from React’s point of view.

#### Rendering a Component

Previously, we only encountered React elements that represent DOM tags:

```
const element = <div />;
```

However, elements can also represent user-defined components:

```
const element = <Welcome name="Sara" />;
```

When React sees an element representing a user-defined component, it passes JSX attributes to this component as a single object. We call this object **props**.
The following code will render "Hello, Sara" on the page.

```
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}

const element = <Welcome name="Sara" />;
ReactDOM.render(
  element,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

#### Extracting Components

Consider this Comment component:

```
function Comment(props) {
  return (
    <div className="Comment">
      <div className="UserInfo">
        <img className="Avatar"
          src={props.author.avatarUrl}
          alt={props.author.name}
        />
        <div className="UserInfo-name">
          {props.author.name}
        </div>
      </div>
      <div className="Comment-text">
        {props.text}
      </div>
      <div className="Comment-date">
        {formatDate(props.date)}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This can be broken up into smaller components. First, we will extract Avatar:

```
function Avatar(props) {
  return (
    <img className="Avatar"
      src={props.user.avatarUrl}
      alt={props.user.name}
    />

  );
}
```

The Avatar doesn’t need to know that it is being rendered inside a Comment. This is why we have given its prop a more generic name: user rather than author.

> **React recommends naming props from the component’s own point of view rather than the context in which it is being used.**

Now comment looks like this

```
function Comment(props) {
  return (
    <div className="Comment">
      <div className="UserInfo">
        <Avatar user={props.author} />
        <div className="UserInfo-name">
          {props.author.name}
        </div>
      </div>
      <div className="Comment-text">
        {props.text}
      </div>
      <div className="Comment-date">
        {formatDate(props.date)}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Next, we will extract a UserInfo component that renders an Avatar next to the user’s name:

```
function UserInfo(props) {
  return (
    <div className="UserInfo">
      <Avatar user={props.user} />
      <div className="UserInfo-name">
        {props.user.name}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This lets use simplify Comment even further

```
function Comment(props) {
  return (
    <div className="Comment">
      <UserInfo user={props.author} />
      <div className="Comment-text">
        {props.text}
      </div>
      <div className="Comment-date">
        {formatDate(props.date)}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

####Props are Read-Only
Whether you declare a component as a function or a class, it must never modify its own props. Consider this sum function:

```
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

Such functions are called **pure** because they do not attempt to change their inputs, and always return the same result for the same inputs.

In contrast, this function is impure because it changes its own input:

```
function withdraw(account, amount) {
  account.total -= amount;
}
```

React is pretty flexible but it has a single strict rule:

> **All React components must act like pure functions with respect to their props.**
